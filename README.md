# Shantell Sans Specimen

A web specimen for [Shantell Sans](http://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans).

## Background

This is a continuation and extension of [arrowtype/shantell-sans-specimen](https://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans-specimen).

This version was started with SvelteKit and [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte), to better support multiple pages.

## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
