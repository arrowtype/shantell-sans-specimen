_Shantell Sans mixes variable axes for Weight, Italic, Irregularity, and Bounce to deliver a wide array of font styles, from friendly, readable, everyday typographic workhorses to striking, high-energy, experimental styles meant especially for animation._

In school, British visual artist [Shantell Martin ](https://shantellmartin.art/)was scared of spelling tests but she felt how words could be art and emotional relief. A discovery in her early 20s opened her eyes to why reading and writing were so difficult for her and motivated her to create the Shantell Sans typeface to inspire others to have fun with writing and words. She teamed up with Stephen Nixon of [Arrow Type](https://www.arrowtype.com/) to create Shantell Sans.

My first relationship with words was back in elementary school. We did spelling tests every week. Since I never passed them, I had to sit in detention.

Despite being scared of the test, I loved words. I wrote and drew a lot. I knew that words helped me to express my feelings and feel better. Since I was writing for myself, I didn't have to care about spelling. 

When I was 20 or 21, I found out that I was dyslexic when I started my art degree at [Central Saint Martins](https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins) in London. I was in an environment where it felt like the majority of people were dyslexic.  I was instantly part of a cool group of creative people. However, I was angry about the amount of teachers who had never spotted my reading challenges. Instead of supporting me to learn to read and write, they punished me.

Creating my own font was a way to empower people to read and write, despite their reading challenges. A few years ago, I thought, “Well, what if I could create my own font?” What if I take my words, or my handwriting or the letters that I've created, and make a font that is fun and playful, but also professional and usable. I wanted to make a font that feels accessible and open to remind people, including myself, that words are drawings and that words can exist on our own terms. I was inspired by Comic Sans because since I was a kid, I have liked how playful and easy it was to read, especially for me as a dyslexic.

I think we have an emotional response to fonts. A font might feel easier to read, or it feels more welcoming. Or it feels like something I want to look at or pick up. I definitely like fonts that have a little bit more space, because they feel more approachable. If you have a really tiny, fancy font, I don't want to touch it. It feels like there are some hurdles there. The usage of a font can make that font take on a certain personality. If you're very dyslexic, you're not going to pick up a book printed in a tiny font with words very close together. It feels intimidating. Or if the font is very plain and boring,  it doesn't capture your attention enough to want to spend time with it.

Stephen Nixon sent me a template, with lines on it for me to handwrite all of the Latin alphabet, numbers, and symbols. He used my handwriting to create a digital font.

**Giving the font away**

I made the choice to release it under an open font [license](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/licensing), which means that I'm not charging anyone for it. It's my gift to the world.

I wanted to create a typeface by a living artist, and perhaps inspire other living artists to create their own typography. I'm curious to see what people will do with it. I'm giving up control over something that is innately mine since Shantell Sans is based on my handwriting and is quite personal. 

I would really love to see children and young adults use it and learn about how it came about. I want to see it being used for personal projects, or even bigger design projects. I think with something like this, when you put it out into the wild, it's going to be used in ways that you probably didn't even think of.

I have started to use Shantell Sans in some of my projects. I designed key tags with Shantell Sans type for the [Whitney Museum shop](https://shantellmartin.art/work/x-whitney-museum-shop/) in New York City. I also did a project with Cash App, a financial services platform, to create a cash card. The cash tag and the numbers and everything on the back of the card is in Shantell Sans.

I collaborated with Google Fonts because I wanted to find a partner that could make the font be visible and successful.


## Design Process

**Stephen Nixon, type designer**

When Shantell reached out and said, “Let’s make a marker font,” I was on board from the start.

I first encountered Shantell’s work in a large mural, which I love for its exploratory, semi-spontaneous, and playful line artwork. 

Marker fonts, such as Comic Sans, are designed to mimic the appearance of [handwriting](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/handwriting) done with a marker. Although they elicit an emotional response,  they are an underappreciated genre of type design. 

To make a great market font with widespread adoption, I had these 5 goals: 



1. Appeal to everyday computer users
2. Function well in a wide variety of communication (display and text)
3. Do something new
4. Be legible, accessible, and easy to read
5. Be an adaptation of Shantell’s marker handwriting

**1. Appeal ** \


For it to be easy to use, Shantell Sans had to have the proportions and styles of a modern font. 

Shantell Sans matches the general average for proportions and weights of most modern, common sans-serif fonts. This familiarity helps make it easy for designers to use in a wide variety of projects.



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


_Caption: A comparison of Shantell Sans to Roboto, showing that they share similar overall proportions_

Alt text: Two columns of six lines of text in Shantell Sans and Roboto

**2. Function for different types of communication ** \


The spacing had to work well for small text. The letters are a little wider than an average font, and the spacing between them isn’t too tight. Also, the kerning is optimized for smallish sizes. The typeface had to support a wide range of languages (380+) and be open-source.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


_Caption: Some of the languages supported by Shantell Sans _

_Alt text: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights in different languages on 14 lines _

**3. Explore new territory** \


To offer flexibility, the font should have a good range of weights and be a variable font. I brought the spontaneous and vibrant quality of Shantell’s work into some experimental variable axes. For detailed typography for densely-packed information, such as on a business card, the typeface had to also include OpenType features like tabular vs proportional figures, fractions, and localized forms.

![alt_text](images/image7.gif "image_tooltip")

_Alt text: “Typography is kinetic” text changing shape _

**4. Easy to read ** \


To make sure the font met Shantell’s goals of making an easy-to-read font, I made sure that the characters could be distinguished from one another. Shantell naturally writes letters like “b”, “d”, “p”, “q” and “n” and “u” that are clearly differentiated from one another through a contrast of simple shapes and well-placed exit [strokes](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/stroke). Shantell sometimes writes the uppercase “I” and numeral “1” as only straight lines. To keep these letters distinct, I added serifs to the uppercase “I” and a flag to “1.”

The lowercase “n” and “u” are differentiated because the “n” has a typical, "zig-zag" form, while the u has a simplified form without a tail or exit stroke. 



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png).

![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


Caption: Exit strokes, flags, and zig-zag differentiate letters with similar structures. 

Alt text: Nine letterforms on two lines of text 

As you might expect in a handwritten font, the “a” and “g” use the single-story forms that kids tend to learn in school, keeping the font friendly and familiar. 



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


Caption: The single-story lowercase “a” and “g” \
Alt text: The “a” and “g” highlighted in the word “amazing”

To ensure that Shantell Sans stays readable in blocks of text, the [glyph](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/glyph) [widths](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/width) and margins are slightly generous. 

**5. Adaptation of marker handwriting ** \


We didn’t want to replicate Shantell’s handwriting. We wanted to create a successful font with Shantell’s writing as a core inspiration. 

Shantell chose her favorite medium-sized felt tip marker ([Staedtler Lumocolor M](https://www.staedtler.com/intl/en/products/markers/permanent-marker/lumocolor-31-mixed-sets-universal-pens-31-9wp4gs/)) and wrote several uppercase and lowercase pangrams (sentences including all letters of the alphabet). She also wrote strings of numbers, punctuation, and symbols, plus a few words with [diacritics/accent marks](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/diacritic_accent_marks). 



<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Caption:  holding a Staedtler Lumocolor M, the same marker used to write the sample text (pictured in the background). The markers are custom-printed with Shantell Sans

Alt text: Right hand holding two markers, paper with handwriting

I traced Shantell’s writing samples and then converted her handwriting into a digital font. This process required balancing two objectives: keeping the best, most unique gestures, while normalizing heights, widths, spacing, and upright balance.



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Caption: Top: Shantell’s handwriting, Bottom: Shantell Sans Semibold digital font

 \
Alt text: Letters “r, f, t, G, P, A, R, M, W” on two lines 

The strokes are drawn with a little bit of the sharpness and contrast that helps make Shantell’s writing so engaging. They are also made a little more uniform in thickness and given softened, semi-rounded endings. 

The sizing and spacing of Shantell’s handwritten letters varied. Since fonts have letters that are regularized and balanced with one another, I subtly modified the character proportions to have consistent heights, widths, spacing, and upright balance. For example, the uppercase "O" is about the same height and width as an uppercase "H", and a lowercase "n" has about the same height and width as a lowercase "x."

 \
**New axes  \
 \
 \
**Shantell Sans includes stylistic axes for _Bounce, Irregularity,_ and _Tracking_. These axes don’t yet exist in other variable fonts, but hopefully they will someday!

For the Bouncy axes, the glyphs are shifted up or down. In the Irregularity axis, the glyph shapes go between normalized and irregular drawings. Together, these axes subtly shift text towards the irregular proportions and quirks in Shantell’s handwriting.

Both of these axes have several alternates of letters, numerals, and key symbols. These alternates are automatically put into text, allowing for a randomized appearance of the letters,  which is similar to what naturally occurs when someone writes by hand and some of the same letters take different shapes in different words.

### **Extending the typeface for Google Fonts and open-source release**

With some funding from Google Fonts, we extended the fonts to include wider language support: the Latin script was expanded to support more Latin-script languages, including Vietnamese and to include many more currency symbols. We also added Cyrillic with the help of type designer .


### Designing Shantell Sans Cyrillic

**Anya Danilova, Type Designer**

Translating handwriting typefaces from one script to another feels somewhat similar to translating poetry. Just like a translator deliberates about how to save the meaning and the rhythm of the poetry and ponders about which words and phrases are characteristic of the author or idiomatic, I wondered about how to maintain Shantell’s identity in Cyrillic. 

Cyrillic is the script for many Eurasian languages: Bulgarian, Serbian, Russian, Belarussian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Bashkir, and many more. 

Some Cyrillic letters have different shapes for [upright (regular)](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/regular_upright), [italic](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/italic), and cursive ([handwriting](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/handwriting)) letterforms.

Shantell’s handwriting is a mixture of cursive and printed shapes. Since Shantell writes only in the Latin script, I had to think about how to translate her shapes into Cyrillic. Which ones would be cursive? Which ones would be upright? I asked Shantell to write a couple of Russian sentences to see her approach to unfamiliar shapes. I asked her to write one word with different shapes of letters.

_Caption: Shantell’s writing in Cyrillic had different shapes for the same letters. Words pictured: щупальца (tentacles), шумят (making noise), овод (gadfly), жаба (frog)_

Simultaneously, I drew these versions in the font. While Shantell wrote out different Cyrillic letters, I used using a font creation software program to design Cyrillic glyphs based on the Latin Shantell Sans glyphs that Stephen Nixon had made.

_Versions of letters_

_*_

After creating alternate versions for the same letters based on Shantell’s writing and my type designs, I decided on which letterforms to keep both based on my feelings and by consulting with other Cyrillic type designers: Maria Doreuli, Krista Radoeva, Alexey Vanyashin, and Jovanna Jocić. They also helped me decide on letterforms that are specific to other languages using the Cyrillic alphabet, such as the њ (for the “nje” sound) in Serbian.

It was an incredible pleasure to work on this project.  There were many challenges but they made creating Shantell Sans  Cyrillic more interesting.
