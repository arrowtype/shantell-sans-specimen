# The Making of Shantell Sans

In school, British visual artist [Shantell Martin](https://shantellmartin.art/) was scared of spelling tests but she felt how words could be art and emotional relief. A discovery in her early 20s opened her eyes to why reading and writing were so difficult for her and motivated her to create the Shantell Sans typeface to inspire others to have fun with writing and words. She teamed up with Stephen Nixon of [Arrow Type](https://www.arrowtype.com/) to create Shantell Sans. 

## Why make a new font?

**Shantell Martin, Artist**


My first relationship with words was back in elementary school. We did spelling tests every week. Since I never passed them, I had to sit in detention.

Despite being scared of the test, I loved words. I wrote and drew a lot. I knew that words helped me to express my feelings and feel better. Since I was writing for myself, I didn't have to care about spelling. 

When I was 20 or 21, I found out that I was dyslexic when I started my art degree at Central Saint Martins in London. I was in an environment where it felt like the majority of people were dyslexic.  I was instantly part of a cool group of creative people. However, I was angry about the amount of teachers who had never spotted my reading challenges. Instead of supporting me to learn to read and write, they punished me.
